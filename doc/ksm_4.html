<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="ksm_toc.html#TOC4">Literals</A></H1>

<P>
In KSM-Scheme, literals represent characters, strings, numbers,
booleans, and other objects.




<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="ksm_toc.html#TOC5">Characters</A></H2>

<P>
Characters are written using the notation <CODE>#\&#60;character&#62;</CODE> or
<CODE>#\&#60;character name&#62;</CODE>. For example,



<PRE>
#\a             ; lower case letter
#\A             ; upper case letter
#\(             ; left parenthesis
#\              ; the space character
#\space         ; the preferred way to write a space
#\newline       ; the newline character
</PRE>

<P>
Case is significant in <CODE>#\&#60;character&#62;</CODE>, but not in
<CODE>#\&#60;character name&#62;</CODE>. If <CODE>&#60;characer&#62;</CODE> in <CODE>#\&#60;character&#62;</CODE>
is alphabetic, then the character following <CODE>&#60;character&#62;</CODE> must be a
delimiter character such as a space or parenthesis. This rule resolves
the ambiguous case where, for example, the sequence of characters
<CODE>#\space</CODE> could be taken to be either a representation of the space
character or a representation of the character <CODE>#\s</CODE> followed by a
representation of the identifier <CODE>pace</CODE>.


<P>
In KSM-Scheme, characters can also be written in the form of
<CODE>#\U{XXXX}</CODE>, which represents a character with Unicode code value
of <CODE>XXXX</CODE> (hexadecimal).



<PRE>
#\U{63}       ; small letter a
#\U{D}        ; carriage return
#\U{3042}     ; hiragana letter a
#\U{feff}     ; zero width no-break space
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="ksm_toc.html#TOC6">Strings</A></H2>

<P>
Strings are sequences of characters. Strings are written as sequences of
characters enclosed within doublequotes ("). A doublequote can be
written inside a string only by escaping it with a backslash (\), as in



<PRE>
"The word \"recursion\" has many meanings."
</PRE>

<P>
A backslash can be written inside a string only by escaping it with
another backslash. In KSM-Scheme, additional escaping sequences are
present, as follows.



<PRE>
"\""      ==&#62; "  (a string composed of a doublequote character)
"\\"      ==&#62; \
"\n"      ==&#62; newline
"\r"      ==&#62; carriage return
"\t"      ==&#62; tab
"\U{XXXX} ==&#62; character corresponding to Unicode 
              code value XXXX (hexadecimal)
</PRE>

<P>
When a backslash is followed by a character that is not listed above,
backslash looses its special meaning and represents a backslash
character by itself.



<PRE>
"\b"  ==&#62; a string composed of two characters ('\' and 'b').
</PRE>

<P>
In KSM-Scheme, a string constant may include a newline character. In
other words, a string constant may continue from one line to the next.



<PRE>
"line 1
line 2"    ==&#62; a string including a newline 
</PRE>

<P>
The <EM>length</EM> of a string is the number of characters that it
contains. This number is an exact, non-negative integer that is fixed
when the string is created. The <EM>valid indexes</EM> of a string are the
exact non-negative integers less than the length of the string. The
first character of a string has index 0, the second has index 1, and so
on.


<P>
In KSM-Scheme, a string is encoded by UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation
Format, 8-bit form". This means that if all the characters in a string
are ASCII characters (that is, #\U{00} through #\U{7F}) the
length of the string is equal with the byte size of the
string. However, if it includes a character out of this range, the byte
size of the string is larger than its length.


<P>
In phrases such as "the characters of <EM>string</EM> beginning with index
<EM>start</EM> and ending with index <EM>end</EM>," it is understood that
the index <EM>start</EM> is inclusive and the index <EM>end</EM> is
exclusive. Thus if <EM>start</EM> and <EM>end</EM> are the same index, a
null substring is referred to, and if <EM>start</EM> is zero and
<EM>end</EM> is the length of <EM>string</EM>, then the entire string is
referred to.




<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="ksm_toc.html#TOC7">Numbers</A></H2>

<P>
A number may be written in binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal by the
use of a radix prefix. The radix prefixes are <CODE>#b</CODE> (binary),
<CODE>#o</CODE> (octal), <CODE>#d</CODE> (decimal), and <CODE>#x</CODE>
(hexadecimal). With no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be expressed
in decimal.



<PRE>
#b1011    ==&#62; 11   (decimal)
#o1011    ==&#62; 521  (decimal)
#d1011    ==&#62; 1011 (decimal)
#x1011    ==&#62; 4113 (decimal)
</PRE>

<P>
A numerical constant may be specified to be either exact (that is,
integer) or inexact (that is, floating point number) by a prefix. The
prefixes are <CODE>#e</CODE> for exact, and <CODE>#i</CODE> for inexact. An
exactness prefix may appear before or after any radix prefix that is
used. If the written represen representation of a number has no
exactness prefix, the constant may be either inexact or exact. It is
inexact if it contains a decimal point or an exponent.



<PRE>
12345     ==&#62; integer (exact)
123.45    ==&#62; floating point number (inexact)
123.4e5   ==&#62; floating point number
#eb1011   ==&#62; 11 (decimal, exact)
#ib1011   ==&#62; 11.0 (decimal, inexact)
#bi1011   ==&#62; 11.0 (same as above)
</PRE>

<P>
A rational number is written in the form &#60;integer&#62;/&#60;positive
integer&#62;. Between &#60;integer&#62;, '/', and &#60;positive integer&#62;, no space is
allowed. Radix prefixes are not allowed to write &#60;integer&#62;. Rational
numbers are supported only if GMP library is available ("libgmp.so" and
"gmp.h" exist).



<PRE>
1/2       ==&#62; one half (rational)
2/4       ==&#62; 1/2 (same as above)
</PRE>

<P>
A complex number is written in the form &#60;number&#62;+&#60;number&#62;i. That is, a
number followed immediately by '+', another number and 'i'. First number
specifies the real part and the second specifies the imaginary
part. Radix prefixes are not allowed to write &#60;number&#62;. 



<PRE>
1+2i
0+-2i       ==&#62; real part is 0; imaginary part is -2
1.2+3.4i
-2.3+4.5i   ==&#62; real part is -2.3; imaginary part is 4.5
