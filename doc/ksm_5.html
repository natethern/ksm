<P>
List is represented by a sequence of elements within parentheses. Each
element is separated by space.



<PRE>
(1 2 3 4 5)
(apple banana orange)
(#\H #\e #\l #\l #\o)
</PRE>

<P>
Evaluation of a list is conducted in two different ways depending on the
first element in the list. When evaluation of the first element results
in a function, remaining elements are evaluated and the function is
called with those evaluated values as arguments. For example, the
identifier <CODE>+</CODE> evaluates to a function that returns the sum of its
arguments. 



<PRE>
(+ 1 2)             ==&#62; 3
(+ 1 2 3 4)         ==&#62; 10
(+ (+ 1 2) (+ 3 4)  ==&#62; 10
</PRE>

<P>
In another form of evaluation, the first element represents an
invocation of pre-defined special form. How the remaining elements are
evaluated depends on the individual special forms. For example,
<CODE>define</CODE> represents a special form that defines a variable. The first
argument indicates the name of the variable, and the evaluation of the
second argument specifies the value of the variable.



<PRE>
(define a (+ 10 20))
</PRE>

<P>
Evaluation of the above form returns an unspecified value. As a side
effect, it defines a variable named <CODE>a</CODE> whose value is 30.


<P>
In Scheme, lists are constructed from pairs. A pair is a record
structure with two fields called the <EM>car</EM> and <EM>cdr</EM> fields
(for historical reasons). A two-element list is a pair whose car is the
first element and whose cdr is a pair whose car is the second element
and whose cdr is the empty list. The empty list is a special object of
its own and is represented by <CODE>()</CODE>.


<P>
The most general notation for Scheme pairs is the "dotted" notation
<CODE>(c1 . c2)</CODE> where <CODE>c1</CODE> is the value of the car field and
<CODE>c2</CODE> is the value of the cdr field. For example <CODE>(4 . 5)</CODE> is a
pair whose car is <CODE>4</CODE> and whose cdr is <CODE>5</CODE>. For example,

<PRE>
(a b c d e)
</PRE>

<P>
and

<PRE>
(a . (b . (c . (d . (e . ())))))
</PRE>

<P>
are equivalent notations for a list of symbols.


<P>
A chain of pairs not ending in the empty list is called an
<EM>improper list</EM>. The list and dotted notations can be combined to
represent improper lists:

<PRE>
(a b c . d)
</PRE>

<P>
is equivalent to

<PRE>
(a . (b . (c . d)))
</PRE>
