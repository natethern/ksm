<P>
KSM-Scheme is "free"; this means that everyone is free to use them and
free to reedistribute them on a free basis. KSM-Scheme is not in the
public domain; KSM-Scheme is copyrighted and there are restrictions on
their distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit
everthing that a good cooperating citizen would want to do. What is not
allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of
these programs that they might get from you.


<P>
Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away
copies of this program, that you receive source code or else can get it
if you want it, that you can change this program or use pieces of them
in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.


<P>
To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute
copies of KSM-Scheme, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must tell them their rights.


<P>
Also, for our own protections, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for KSM-Scheme. If this program is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to know
that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.


<P>
The preciese conditions of the licenses for KSM-Scheme currently being
distributed are found in the General Public Licenses that accompany it.
