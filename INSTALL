Installation
============

These are installation instructions for KSM-Scheme.

1. Extract archive. Following command will create a directory `ksm-0.3.1'
   which contains source code.

   $ tar -xzvf ksm-0.3.1.tar.gz

2. `cd' to `ksm-0.3.1'

   $ cd ksm-0.3.1

3. Do configuration

   $ ./configure
   
   By default, necessary files are installed in /usr/local/ksm
   directory, executable `ksm' is installed in /usr/local/bin, man
   file is installed in /usr/local/man, and info files are installed
   in /usr/local/info.
   
   If these defaults are not desirable (for example, all files
   are to be installed in the user's home directory), following
   options to ./configure can be used.

   $ ./configure --prefix=/home/hangil

   With this option (--prefix), necessary files are installed in 
   /home/hangil/ksm, executable in /home/hangil/bin, and info
   files in /home/hangil/info

   $ ./configure --prefix=/home/hangil --bindir=/usr/bin

   With this option (--prefix and --bindir), necessary files
   are installed in /home/hangil/ksm, executable int /usr/bin, 
   and info files in /home/hangil/info

   $ ./configure --prefix=/home/hangil --bindir=/usr/bin --infodir=/usr/info

   With this option (--prefix and --bindir), necessary files
   are installed in /home/hangil/ksm, executable int /usr/bin, 
   and info files in /usr/info

   $ ./configure --mandir=/usr/man

   man file is installed in /usr/man

4. Do make

   $ make

5. Do install

   $ install

Depending on the circumstances, PATH or INFOPATH environment variables
may be adjusted. For example, if the directory under which executable 
`ksm' is installed is not included in PATH, 

   $ export PATH=/home/hangil/bin:$PATH

If the directory under which info files are installed cannot be
accessed by `info' command,

   $ export INFOPATH=/home/hangil/info:$INFOPATH

In the distribution, sample Scheme programs are included ("r5rs.scm"
and "pi.scm") under the ksm-0.3.0 directory. "pi.scm" is from SCM
Scheme ditribution. It uses bignum features of KSM-SCheme, which is
available only under the system that has GMP library. If the system
does not have GMP library, `(load "pi.scm")' will raise an error.
  
   $ ksm 
   > (load "r5rs.scm")
   ...
   > (load "pi.scm")
   #<unspecified>
   > (pi 1000)
