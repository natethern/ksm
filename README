Installation
============

Please refer to the file "INSTALL".

Invoking KSM-Scheme
===================

KSM-Scheme is invoked from the command line as

ksm [options] [FILE ARG ...]

Acceptable options are

-xl FILE        load FILE before starting the interpreter
-xc ENCODING    set the default encoding to ENCODING
-xh             display the help information

If ENCODING is specified, input files (including standard input)
are assumed to be encoding by @var{encoding} and they are automatically
converted to UTF-8 encoding while reading the file. Output files
(including standard output and standard error) are automatically
converted to @var{encoding} from UTF-8 that is the internal encoding in
KSM-Scheme.

For example, to use KSM-Scheme under the circumstances in which
`kterm' with default encoding of EUC-JP is used, following
invocation will provide the desirable interaction.

ksm -xc EUC-JP

If FILE is specified, it should be the name of a Scheme source
file. The KSM-Scheme interpreter loads the file and then
terminates. If FILEfile is omitted, KSM-Scheme enters an interactive
mode and accepts Scheme source from standard input.

If ARGS are specified, it is passed the FILE program as command line
arguments. They can be accessed by `cmdline-args' from the
program.

$ cat src.scm
(display (cmdline-args))
(newline)
$ ksm src.scm a b c
(src.scm a b c)
